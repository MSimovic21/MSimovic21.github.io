								<h3>How do physical factors shape axial xylem morphology?</h3>
								<p> Xylem conduit morphology is shaped by two fundamental constraints imposed by vertical sap transport: minimizing hydraulic resistance and preventing conduit wall collapse. 
								    Nehemiah Grew observed that roots have wider conduits than stems nearly 350 years ago, and there has been much research since showing that conduits widen predictably from tips of plants to their base in order to minimize resistance.
								    But what about conduit reinforcement, or the ratio of double wall thickness to conduit diameter? 
								    Thickness-to-span ratio should decrease from tip to base, in tandem with water potential. 
								    My PhD advisor Sean Michaletz and I show that both of these patterns occur in trees, and that thickness-to-span ratios are nearly always higher than the critical collapse limit predicted by a hydraulic model.
								    This work is currently in preparation, with aim to submit it to New Phytologist for publication.

								<h3>A novel method of balancing datasets via bootstrapping</h3>
								<p>Much of ecology is focused on quantifying scaling relationships using empirical data and comparing results across datasets or with theoretical predictions. 
								   This is typically accomplished by fitting linear models to log-transformed data, estimating the slope (often representing scaling exponents or exponential rate constants) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), and evaluating whether these CIs include empirical or theoretical values.
								   The accuracy of slope estimates depends critically on the distribution of data across the range of the abscissa. 
								   When data are unevenly distributed, with observations concentrated in some portions of the range, slope and CI estimates become biased toward regions of higher data density. 
								   This imbalance increases the risk of type I or II errors, potentially leading to erroneous conclusions about the agreement of data with empirical or theoretical expectations. 
								   We introduce a novel bootstrapping approach to address data imbalance in biological scaling analyses that improves the accuracy of slope and CI estimates. 
								   This method enables more precise comparisons with both empirical and theoretical values.
								   This work (coauthored by Sean Michaletz) is currently in review in Global Ecology and Biogeography.

								<h3>Size and functional traits modulate urban tree performance and capacity for delivering ecosystem services.</h3>
								<p>Recent empirical work by <a href="https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1365-2745.12594" target="_blank"><strong>Gibert et al. 2016</strong></a> and theoretical work by <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29959205/" target="_blank"><strong>Falster et al. 2018</strong></a>
								postulates that the relationship between functional traits and plant performance is strongly modulated by plant size. My MSc advisor, <a href="https://kevinemueller.wordpress.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Kevin Mueller</strong></a>, and I, tested this hypothesis in an urban setting, and found strong support for it. 
								Moreover, we found a strong relationship between key functional traits (e.g., LDMC and wood density) and ecosystem services such as C sequestration, suggesting that the trait-performance framework can be applied to solve practical problems such as maximizing tree-based ecosystem services in urban areas.
								This work has been published in the journal Functional Ecology and can be accessed <a href="https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1365-2435.14505" target="_blank"><strong>here</strong></a>.
